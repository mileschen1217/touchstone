  Scaffold, maintain, and audit a project's epic-driven roadmap. Every project
  using this convention keeps a pure-tracker ROADMAP.md plus one tracker per
  epic under .m-workflow/epics/<slug>/index.md. Invoke when: starting a new epic,
  closing an epic (retrospective + move to Completed), auditing status drift,
  or bootstrapping the convention in a new project. Concrete paths come from
  the project's CLAUDE.md § Doc Routing; this skill owns the shape, templates,
  and procedures.

# m-epic-driven-roadmap

## Step 0 — Load vocabulary

> Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/step0-resolver.md`
> with the Read tool and follow it exactly.

This skill does not dispatch to other skills, so no envelope handoff is needed.

If `source-as-truth` is not adopted: Stage 7 doc reckoning runs in default mode (mechanical mtime-based bridge audit only, no frontmatter kind: classification, no distill-or-archive recommendation).

Pure-tracker roadmap + per-epic tracker convention. CLAUDE.md routes here; this skill owns the rule and the templates.

## When to Invoke

- **Scaffold a new epic** — user starts work on a new initiative not yet tracked.
- **Close an epic** — all phases done, needs retrospective + move to Completed table.
- **Audit** — weekly or on demand: status drift between ROADMAP row and epic frontmatter, stale epics, orphans, scope overlap.
- **Bootstrap** — new project adopts this convention (ROADMAP.md + `.m-workflow/epics/README.md` + first epic).

Skip if: the project doesn't use this convention (no `ROADMAP.md` or `.m-workflow/epics/`).

## The Rule

**Trackers are shallow pointers; content docs hold the detail.**

Trackers (ROADMAP row + epic index) may contain: title, one-sentence aim, status fields, links to content docs, phases table (one row per shippable increment), pivots (one line each), open questions (one line each), retrospective bullets on close.

Trackers may **not** contain: design prose, rationale, research findings, architectural content. Any paragraph longer than one sentence is a rule violation — move it to a content doc and link.

**Status vocabulary:** `proposed | active | paused | done | cancelled`.

## Question-per-stage pipeline

Maps to the 6-stage workflow in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

| Q (stage) | Home (abstract) |
|---|---|
| Why at all? (0) | Project vision / scope |
| Why this epic? (1) | Epic tracker index |
| What might work? (2) | Research note |
| What contract? (3, GWT) | Design spec |
| How, in order — epic-level? (4a) | **Epic master plan** (lives with the epic) |
| How, in order — per-spec? (4b) | Implementation plan (one per design spec) |
| Did it work? (5) | Commits, MRs |
| What did we learn? (6) | Retrospective on epic index |
| Did docs catch up? (7) | Doc Reckoning block on epic index (see "Close an epic") |

Concrete paths live in the project's CLAUDE.md § Doc Routing.

### Master plan vs. task plan

Two distinct artifacts; do not conflate.

- **Epic master plan (Q4a)** — sequences the epic's phases, locks cross-spec decisions (e.g. "primary gate is X, deprecate Y"), states effort + acceptance per phase, freezes scope so reactive expansion is rejected. Lives **with the epic**: `.m-workflow/epics/<slug>/<short-name>.md` (e.g. `v6-3-roadmap.md`, `roadmap.md`, or `master-plan.md`). The epic index links to it. One per epic — not per phase.
- **Task plan (Q4b)** — per-spec implementation plan for a single design spec. Lives under `docs/superpowers/plans/` (or the project's plan path). One per spec.

**When to write a master plan:** an epic that crosses 2+ design specs, locks methodology decisions that bind multiple specs, or needs effort sequencing across phases. Skinny epics (single spec, one PR) skip the master plan and go straight from epic index → spec → plan.

**Master plan vs. epic index:** the index is a **tracker** (one-liners, links). The master plan is **prose with tables** (decisions, phase effort, dependency graph, acceptance criteria). The index links to the master plan; it does not absorb it.

## Procedures

### Scaffold a new epic

0. **Foundation elicitation (Baseline — always runs)** — before slugging
   anything, run the 3-field elicitation gate.

   Reuse check FIRST (AC-10): if a foundation was already confirmed earlier
   in THIS SAME skill invocation (a later procedure step re-enters Step 0),
   do NOT re-elicit. Emit this EXACT log line verbatim (fixed emit string —
   do not paraphrase, do not reword):
   "Foundation already confirmed this session — reusing"
   then reuse the confirmed foundation and skip to step e. Do NOT emit the
   from-scratch opener. Reuse is same-invocation only; it never spans
   separate invocations. Otherwise run the gate:

   a. Open with this EXACT phrase (fixed emit string):
      "Please describe the intended work in your own words." The substring
      "describe the intended work in your own words" is what AC-7's bypass
      fixtures match (Step-0 reached) and what AC-4 forbids as the
      from-scratch opener — keep it verbatim, do not paraphrase. No fixed
      follow-up questions — let the user give context freely.

   b. Engage in a SHORT sharpening exchange. Ask only questions in
      the ALLOWED column of the boundary table (§ Interfaces — Step-0
      question boundary). Stop as soon as intention / aim / out-of-
      scope are crisp. Never ask a question in the FORBIDDEN column
      (architecture, files, dependencies, tests, API shape, effort,
      rollout, or fix strategy) — those are design-phase decisions.

   c. Synthesise a draft foundation and present it to the user using
      these EXACT field labels (verbatim — AC-1/AC-2 match them
      case-sensitively):
      - "Intention (why):" motivation / pain in one line
      - "Aim:" observable success at epic scope in one line
        (recorded into the **Aim:** headline, not a ## Foundation field)
      - "Out of scope:" ≤3 explicit routes not taken

      The SYNTHESISED aim must not contain a vague token
      {usually, typically, should, elegant, complex, careful, better}.
      If the user's stated aim contains one, do NOT carry it into the
      draft — re-prompt for an OBSERVABLE formulation: ask what the user
      would observe or measure when it's done (targeted clarifying
      questions are fine; "what would you observe when this is done?" is a
      good default). Do not synthesise until the aim is observable. (AC-8.)

      If the user declines to name any out-of-scope route, prompt
      once: "can you name one thing this work will NOT touch, even if
      related?" If still declined, record this EXACT sentinel verbatim
      (fixed string — do not paraphrase, this literal only) as the
      out-of-scope value: "(no explicit boundary declared)" AND add a
      matching entry to the epic's Open Questions. The sentinel is the one
      allowed placeholder.

   d. Surface the draft foundation to the user and ask, with this exact
      phrase: "Please confirm or edit this foundation." Do not proceed
      to step 1 until confirmed. If the user insists on an aim that
      contains a vague token, warn with this EXACT phrase verbatim (fixed
      emit string — do not paraphrase, do not reword):
      "(aim contains a vague token — accept anyway?)"
      On accept, record the user's aim verbatim AND add this EXACT risk
      note verbatim to Open Questions (do not paraphrase):
      "(aim contains an unverifiable token — user-confirmed)"

   e. Record the confirmed foundation: aim into the **Aim:** headline,
      intention + out-of-scope into ## Foundation (template below).
      This is the highest-ROI step — it prevents a spec being written
      for the wrong scope.
1. Pick a slug — lowercase, hyphen-separated, names the **deliverable surface** (e.g. `port-statistics-stacking`), not a phase number.
2. Read the project's CLAUDE.md § Doc Routing to get the concrete `.m-workflow/epics/` path.
3. Copy `templates/epic-index.md` to `<epics-dir>/<slug>/index.md`; fill in `slug`, `started` (today), `owner_teams`, aim into the `**Aim:**` headline, intention + out-of-scope into `## Foundation` (from step 0), and Phase 1.
4. Add a row to `ROADMAP.md` § Active Epics: `| <slug> | <aim> | proposed | [index](<epics-dir>/<slug>/index.md) |`.
5. When creating content docs (research, specs, plans, ADRs) for this epic, add frontmatter `epics: [<slug>]` so the backlink exists from day one. See `templates/content-doc.md`.
5. Commit.

### Close an epic + Stage 7 Doc Reckoning

Procedure (mark phases done, retrospective, ROADMAP move) + the full Stage-7 doc-reckoning inventory and output template → [`references/close-and-stage7.md`](references/close-and-stage7.md).

### Tasks (scaffold / contract scope / close / status)

Task-id convention, contract-scope heuristics (one-contract-vs-split, executor distribution), close steps, and task status vocabulary → [`references/tasks.md`](references/tasks.md).

### Audit

Bidirectional doc-graph integrity — epic-level, link-health, and task-level checks, running them, and report format → [`references/audit.md`](references/audit.md).

### Bootstrap a new project

Four-step convention bootstrap → [`references/bootstrap.md`](references/bootstrap.md).

## Path schema (project CLAUDE.md § Doc Routing)

Each project fills in concrete paths for the Q-per-stage pipeline:

| Q (stage) | Example concrete path |
|---|---|
| Why at all? (0) | `.m-workflow/vision.md`, `ROADMAP.md` scope block |
| Why this epic? (1) | `.m-workflow/epics/<slug>/index.md` |
| What might work? (2) | `.m-workflow/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` |
| What contract? (3) | `.m-workflow/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` |
| How, in order — epic? (4a) | `.m-workflow/epics/<slug>/<name>-roadmap.md` (only when epic spans 2+ specs) |
| How, in order — per-spec? (4b) | `.m-workflow/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` |
| Did it work? (5) | Commits, MRs |
| What did we learn? (6) | Retrospective on epic index |

Projects may adjust paths; the convention is the shape, not the directory names.

## Templates

- `templates/ROADMAP.md` — pure-tracker ROADMAP
- `templates/epic-index.md` — epic tracker
- `templates/content-doc.md` — research / spec / plan / ADR / reflection (frontmatter shape only; body is free-form)

Copy verbatim; edit in place.
