# Task Contract: <title>

## Scope
- <repos / directories / modules the implementer may freely modify to satisfy AC>
- Globs and individual files are both legal. Implementer may create new files inside Scope without listing them upfront.

## Read-Only Boundaries
- <existing contracts the implementer reads but must not modify>
- Category: cross-team APIs, public traits, schema definitions, vendored deps in this repo.
- If AC appears to require modifying anything here, implementer must fail with `risks` naming the path and the AC that conflicts.

## Do Not Touch
- <hard safety boundary; off-limits even if technically reachable>
- Stronger than Read-Only — implementer should not even read these for context.
- Category: `.git/`, sibling-team directories, vendored crates outside Scope.

## Acceptance Criteria
- <testable outcomes; load-bearing source of truth for "done">
- ACs from the spec/plan; implementer's job is to satisfy these, not to match a file list.

## Commands to Run
- <verification commands; exit codes captured in result.json>

## Owned Files (optional)
- Use ONLY when you need to pin exact files — e.g., parallel implementer dispatch with non-overlapping ownership, or an intentionally narrow refactor.
- When present, narrows Scope further: implementer must touch only these files.
- Default: omit. Scope + AC + Read-Only Boundaries + Do Not Touch are sufficient for most contracts.

## Expected Output
- result.json (schema version 1) at this task-dir
- (optional) review.md if cross-provider review attached

**Implementer behavioral contract** (applies to all runtimes; canonical — codex-* agent role prompts defer here):

1. **Free movement within Scope** — create, modify, or delete files inside Scope without consulting the planner, as long as AC is met. Every path actually written goes into `files_changed`.
2. **Hard stop at Read-Only Boundaries and Do Not Touch** — if AC appears to require modifying any of these, do **not** modify. Set `status: failed` with `risks` naming the path and the AC that conflicts.
3. **Outside-scope necessity → needs-scope-expansion** — if AC requires touching a repo or module outside Scope (not in Read-Only Boundaries / Do Not Touch — i.e. the planner missed it), do **not** modify it. Set `status: needs-scope-expansion`, fill `scope_change_request` (see § Scope-Change Protocol), and return. The orchestrator adjudicates by reversibility and either amends Scope + re-dispatches, or escalates. (Read-Only / Do Not Touch conflicts are different — those mean the AC itself is wrong → rule 2 `failed`.)
4. **Use `observations`** for any context that doesn't fit summary/risks/handoff_notes — unexpected codebase shape, ambiguities resolved by judgment, related issues out of scope, design questions, anything you'd tell the next implementer if you could chat. Don't pre-filter; the orchestrator skims.

## Scope-Change Protocol

When rule 3 fires, the implementer emits a `scope_change_request` in result.json (one home for the schema; CONTEXT.md § Agent dispatch axis points here). The orchestrator adjudicates by **reversibility, not file location**, and logs both request and decision to the epic ledger.

**`scope_change_request` (implementer fills):**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `target` | Out-of-scope **repo or module/directory** needed (matches Scope granularity; never a single file). |
| `ac_ref` | AC **ID** that forces this (pointer only — do not restate the AC). |
| `rationale` | The runtime discovery the contract author could not foresee; why `target` is needed. Do not restate `ac_ref`. |
| `reversibility` | `reversible` or `irreversible`. If you cannot determine it, classify `irreversible`. |
| `reversibility_basis` | Why classed so (e.g. "in-project edit, git-recoverable" / "force-push, history rewrite"). |
| `alternatives_considered` | In-scope routes tried and rejected, or `none`. |

**Adjudication policy (orchestrator):** `reversible` + within project boundary → auto-approve, amend Scope, re-dispatch. `irreversible` or crosses an infra/trust boundary → escalate to human.

**Ledger:** every request + decision appends one line to `.touchstone/epics/<slug>/scope-changes.jsonl` (audit + epic-close retro):

```
{"ts","task_id","request":{…verbatim…},"decision":"approved|denied|escalated-to-human","decided_by":"orchestrator|human","decision_reason","scope_amendment","outcome":"redispatched|abandoned|<task_id>"}
```

**Seam:** this protocol organizes intent + auditability only. Preventing an unauthorized irreversible action is CC's permission mode / hooks / sandbox / git (operator-configured), not this protocol.
