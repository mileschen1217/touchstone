# Bootstrap a new project

## Step 0 — Check touchstone config

Read `.claude/touchstone.yaml` in the project root.

**Absent** → invoke `/touchstone:init` now. Pass the workspace root flag so config is written deterministically even if the context is non-interactive:

    /touchstone:init --workspace-root .touchstone

In a non-interactive context `adopted_disciplines` will be left empty; print the notice:
> `source-as-truth available but not adopted — run /touchstone:init interactively to add`

Then continue to step 1.

**Present AND `source-as-truth` NOT in `adopted_disciplines`** → print:
> `source-as-truth available but not adopted — run /touchstone:init to add`

Continue to step 1. Do NOT re-prompt paths; do NOT silently skip the notice.

**Present AND `source-as-truth` already in `adopted_disciplines`** → continue silently.

**Present but malformed (unparseable YAML)** → print the parse error naming the file; stop. Do NOT guess adoption state or overwrite. (Mirrors `init` Step 1's malformed-yaml branch.)

Discipline-menu logic stays solely in `init`; bootstrap never duplicates it.

## Steps

1. Copy `templates/ROADMAP.md` to the project root.
2. Create `.touchstone/epics/README.md` with the binding rule (copy from this skill's "The Rule" section).
3. Add `## Doc Routing` to project CLAUDE.md using the path schema below.
4. Scaffold the first epic (above).
