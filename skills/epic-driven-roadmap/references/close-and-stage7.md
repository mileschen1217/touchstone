# Close an epic

1. Mark all phases `done` with landed dates.
2. Set frontmatter `status: done`, `landed: YYYY-MM-DD`.
3. Fill the Retrospective block — bullets only; typical: What worked, What pivoted, What to do differently.
4. Run **Stage 7 — Doc Reckoning** (see below) and append the block to the epic index.
4b. Run **Evidence Reckoning** (BLOCKING — distinct from, and does not weaken, the
    advisory Stage 7 above). See § Evidence Reckoning below. Close cannot complete
    until the reckoning table is built and every blocking rule is satisfied.
5. Remove the row from ROADMAP § Active Epics; add to § Completed Epics with the landed date.
6. Commit.

## Stage 7 — Doc Reckoning

Mechanical inventory of what this epic did to the doc graph. Lists facts; does not judge whether a bridge should have been written or whether it should be downgraded to a comment — those are author judgment, intentionally NOT skillified.


**Inputs**

- Epic slug.
- Git range `--since <epic.started> --until <epic.landed>` (or branch range if known).

**Procedure**

1. **Created docs** — enumerate `.md` files added in the git range under the project's doc paths (`.m-workflow/research/`, `.m-workflow/specs/`, `.m-workflow/plans/`, `.m-workflow/docs/`). For each:
   - Read frontmatter `kind:`.
   - If `kind: bridge`, read `kill-on:`. Missing `kill-on:` on a bridge doc → **finding** (advisory; cultural reminder, not gating per the `source-as-truth` discipline).
   - List as `created` with kind + kill-on.

2. **Killed docs** — enumerate `.md` files deleted in the git range. For each, record path + the lever-related commit that removed it (best-effort: the commit message naming a `lever-*` slug, if any).

3. **Pending kills** — grep all surviving `.md` files for frontmatter `kill-on:` values matching lever slugs known to have landed (cross-check ROADMAP § Completed Epics). Any bridge doc whose `kill-on:` points at a landed lever but still exists → **pending kill** (the lever did not delete the doc it was supposed to).

3b. **Stale bridge candidates (mtime check, advisory)** — for each surviving bridge doc this epic touched, compare `git log -1 --format=%ct <bridge-path>` with the most recent `git log -1 --format=%ct <source-path>` of source paths the bridge references (best-effort: extract paths from inline links and `related:` frontmatter). Bridge older than its referenced source by >30 days → flag as **stale-candidate** (does NOT auto-delete; reader judgment required — bridge may still be accurate, or source change may have invalidated it). Per the `source-as-truth` discipline, CONTEXT.md § Bridge content gate — three principles, three-principle re-audit is the human follow-up; this check only surfaces candidates.

3c. **Rung-misclassification candidates (advisory, P3 violation)** — for each bridge `.md` this epic touched, scan section bodies for single-source-path citations. Heuristic: a section whose prose cites **exactly one** source path (single function / single struct / single file) without naming a second cross-cutting location is a rung-2/3 candidate that wandered into rung-4 `.md`. Output the section heading + the lone source path so a human can decide: move to `///` doc-comment (rung 2), or `// BRIDGE` block at call-site (rung 3), or argue it stays rung 4 (cross-cutting reason). Per CONTEXT.md § Bridge content gate — three principles, P3 worked examples — "if you wrote this as a `///` doc-comment, which symbol would you attach it to?" — single answer = wrong rung.

3d. **Doc-as-workaround candidates (advisory, P1 violation)** — scan bridge `.md` sections for prose that exists to explain why dead / duplicative / obsolete source still exists. Trigger phrases (heuristic): "deprecated", "kept until X ships", "do not use", "no-op stub", "ignored after Phase N", "legacy path", "wrapper for backward compatibility". For each match, output the section + suggested action: file a PR to remove the source, OR justify why the source must remain. Per CONTEXT.md § Bridge content gate — three principles, P1 — "would a PR removing the source be more honest than a paragraph explaining it?"

4. **Source-level deposit** — read the epic's design specs (if any) for their `## Source-level Deposit` section (per `m-design-spec` template). Record the lever each spec named, or "none" with the stated reason.

5. **Built spec distill-or-archive (per the `source-as-truth` discipline, CONTEXT.md § Standing vs transient bridge)** — for each spec under this epic whose feature has landed, decide its post-landing path:
   - **Pure transient** (all contracts now in source) → mark for move to `.m-workflow/archive/specs/`, frontmatter change to `kind: diagnostic`, `evidence-for: <commits / MR>`.
   - **Standing-candidate sections present** (P3-pure cross-cutting invariants) → list which sections should distill to `.m-workflow/docs/architecture/<topic>.md` (carrying their own `kill-on:`); residual spec then archives.
   - **Whole spec is cross-cutting** (rare) → copy whole spec to `.m-workflow/docs/architecture/`, retire original.
   This is a judgment call, not auto-executed. Stage 7 surfaces the candidates; the human (or author at next session) executes the move and frontmatter rewrite.

**Output — append to epic `index.md`**

```markdown
## Doc Reckoning (Stage 7)

**Deposit (from specs):**
- `<spec-path>` → advances `<lever-slug>` (or `none — <reason>`)

**Created:**
- `<doc-path>` — kind: `<kind>` · kill-on: `<lever-slug>` (or none — flag if bridge)

**Killed:**
- `<doc-path>` — removed in `<commit-sha>` (advances `<lever-slug>`)

**Pending kills:**
- `<doc-path>` — kill-on `<lever-slug>` (landed `<date>` but doc still present)

**Stale-candidate bridges (advisory):**
- `<doc-path>` — last touched `<date>`; referenced source `<source-path>` last touched `<date>` (+N days newer)

**Rung-misclassification candidates (advisory):**
- `<doc-path>` § `<section heading>` — cites only `<single-source-path>`; suggested rung: 2 (`///` doc-comment) | 3 (`// BRIDGE` block) | argue cross-cutting

**Doc-as-workaround candidates (advisory):**
- `<doc-path>` § `<section heading>` — triggered by `<phrase>`; suggested action: PR to remove `<source-path>` OR justify retention

**Built specs (distill-or-archive candidates):**
- `<spec-path>` — feature landed `<commit-sha>`; recommended path: archive | distill <section-list> → standing bridge | move-whole
```

**Boundaries (what Stage 7 is NOT)**

- Not a judge of bridge rung (rung 2 vs rung 4). Author's call.
- Not a judge of whether the deposit's lever choice was right. Author's call.
- Not a gate. Findings are advisory; the epic may close with bridge docs missing `kill-on:` if the human accepts the residual.

## Evidence Reckoning (BLOCKING — runs at close, before Commit)

A distinct close step from the advisory Stage 7 doc-reckoning. It produces a
per-AC accounting host authored ONCE at close by reading source (so it cannot rot
like a maintained mapping). See `docs/adr/0009-evidence-honesty-gate.md` decision 2c
and the testing-strategy spec Interfaces §5.

**Procedure**

1. **Structural floor first.** For each `status: Accepted` spec of this epic, run
   `scripts/check-spec-floor.sh <spec-path>`. Any non-zero exit BLOCKS close — fix
   the spec (un-enumerable AC set, duplicate AC id, or an empty `[unverified]`
   reason) before continuing. This is the deterministic gate; coverage judgment is
   the reviewer's.

2. **Derive coverage.** Apply the evidence-honesty (coverage) criteria — the SAME
   criteria as `skills/code-review/SKILL.md` batch, **inlined here** so it is
   greppable in this host too (AC-5: criteria present at BOTH batch AND epic-close):

   > Read the governing spec's ACs and the test source. For each AC, judge whether a
   > test asserts that AC's Then-clause (AC coverage, semantic — not code-coverage %,
   > not tool-measured). If an AC is claimed done but no test in source asserts it and
   > it carries no `[unverified]` → report **silent false-green** (blocks the done
   > claim). A test that mocks the very boundary a boundary-crossing AC claims does
   > NOT discharge that claim (proxy, not coverage). Emit `[unverified: reason]` for
   > any AC you cannot confirm — never pass by default. `[unverified]` is honest and
   > allowed (informed-consent); surface findings, do not force passing.

3. **Build the reckoning table** (one row per AC across the epic's accepted specs):

   | AC | Covered by (test / live-artifact ref — verification evidence, derived at close) | [unverified: reason] | live-bearing? | waiver | Issue |
   |----|----------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|--------|-------|

   - "Covered by" = the evidence the reviewer found asserting the AC; blank ⇒ no
     coverage found. For a **non-live-bearing** AC this is a test reference. For a
     **live-bearing** AC (Phase 2) it MUST reference a **live artifact with
     provenance** (producer identity + freshness — commit/timestamp), NOT a static
     proxy (grep result / mock / env-faked condition / deployed-file read).
     Satisfying example cell:
     `Covered by: live artifact .m-workflow/epics/<slug>/evidence/<name>.md @ <commit-sha> via <producer>`
   - "live-bearing?" = "yes" if the AC is listed in its spec's Verification Strategy `Live-bearing AC IDs`.
   - "waiver" = a human, at close, writes a rationale to consciously proceed past a NON-LIVE gap.
   - "Issue" = the filed/linked debt issue for each `[unverified]` / waiver row.

4. **Apply the blocking rules:**
   - A non-live-bearing row with no "Covered by", no `[unverified]`, and no waiver ⇒ **BLOCKS close**.
   - A live-bearing row closes ONLY with a "Covered by" cell that references a
     **live artifact with provenance** (per the table-description above).
     A static proxy (grep / mock / env-faked condition / deployed-file read) does
     NOT satisfy a live-bearing row ⇒ **BLOCKS close**. `[unverified]` is **unavailable** for a
     live-bearing row, and a live-bearing row may NOT be waived. An uncovered /
     `[unverified]` / static-proxy-only live-bearing AC ⇒ **BLOCKS close** — the only
     honest path is to defer the whole AC to a later phase.
   - An `[unverified]` or waiver row with an empty Issue cell ⇒ **BLOCKS close** until a debt issue is filed/linked.
   - An un-reckoned AC (no row) ⇒ **BLOCKS close**.

5. **Record** the completed table in the epic-close block of the epic `index.md`.

A healthy close has an empty `[unverified]` set.
