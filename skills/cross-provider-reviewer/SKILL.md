description: Pattern A composite skill — reviews any artifact using CC `code-reviewer` + Codex `codex-reviewer` in parallel; synthesizes with explicit divergence labeling. Auto-falls back to CC-only when Codex unavailable. Used by `/m-design-review` (with doc-review `system_prompt` via envelope) and available for ad-hoc cross-provider review.

# /m-cross-provider-reviewer — Pattern A Composite Skill

Skill body executes in main-thread context where `Agent` tool is available. Orchestrates parallel CC + Codex review and synthesizes with divergence labeling.

## Inputs (JSON envelope as `args`)

```json
{
  "task": "<diff, doc, or artifact text>",
  "task_dir": "<optional: absolute path for artifact write>",
  "system_prompt": "<optional: domain-specific reviewer prompt; default = code-review>",
  "role": "reviewer",
  "timeout_seconds": 900
}
```

## Procedure

### 1. Probe Codex

```bash
codex --version >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "codex_healthy=1" || echo "codex_healthy=0"
```

### 2. Parallel dispatch (single assistant message, two Agent tool calls)

If `codex_healthy=1`, in ONE message issue BOTH:

- `Agent(subagent_type: "everything-claude-code:code-reviewer", description: "CC review", prompt: <task envelope with system_prompt prefix>)`  <!-- # EXTERNAL DEP — everything-claude-code (Epic B vendors this) -->
- `Agent(subagent_type: "m-workflow:codex-reviewer", description: "Codex review", prompt: <task envelope>)`

Wait for both to return before synthesizing.

If `codex_healthy=0`, call only `everything-claude-code:code-reviewer` and proceed to synthesis with `fallback_reason: "codex unavailable"`.

### 3. Synthesis (deterministic)

Sort raw inputs by provider name (`cc` then `codex`).

Merge findings:
- Same file:line + same category → keep one, attribute to both.
- Disagreement on severity → list both verdicts inline; keep higher severity.
- Unique to one provider → include with attribution.

Always emit a `## Divergence` section when verdicts disagree. Never silently merge.

### 4. Write artifacts (if `task_dir` provided)

- `<task_dir>/raw_cc.md` — CC reviewer output verbatim
- `<task_dir>/raw_codex.jsonl` — Codex reviewer output (raw JSONL)
- `<task_dir>/review.md` — synthesized review
- `<task_dir>/result.json` — schema v1 envelope

### 5. Return synthesized review

Skill body's final assistant text: the synthesized review.md content. The orchestrator caller reads it from shared LLM working memory.

## Synthesis instruction (built-in)

> Merge findings; do not introduce new findings. Preserve provider attribution. Label divergence explicitly. Sort by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low). Emit raw outputs alongside; never silently merge.

## Failure semantics

- Codex probe / dispatch fail → CC-only synthesis with `fallback_reason`.
- Both reviewers fail → `status: failed`, both errors in `risks[]`, no synthesis.
- Skill itself errors (framework) → propagate to caller.

## Cost note

Pattern A — ~2× tokens per invocation. Only invoked at high-leverage gates: doc review (`/m-design-review`), arch consult (`/m-arch-review`), design spec (`/m-design-spec`), or ad-hoc opt-in for high-risk diffs.

## Dependencies

- `everything-claude-code:code-reviewer` (ECC, EXTERNAL) — CC review backend. Epic B vendors or makes optional.
- `m-workflow:codex-reviewer` (plugin-local) — Codex review backend.
- CC-only fallback: if ECC absent, run available provider(s) only + emit synthesis with a `fallback_reason` note; if BOTH absent → no synthesis, surfaced as failure. (Loud-degraded metadata deferred to E14.)
