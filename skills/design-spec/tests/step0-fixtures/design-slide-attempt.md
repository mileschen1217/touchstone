# ── Layer 1 backstop ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for these patterns is spec § Interfaces "AC-3 forbidden
# regex families" (incl. the premature-hand-off guard). The fixture is
# DERIVED: each line from that section joined into ONE grep -iE pattern with
# "|". The fixture field is a one-item list (the single joined pattern), to
# match the schema's list type even in regex mode. If § Interfaces changes,
# regenerate this field — do not hand-edit it independently.
#
# The final alternation "Sharpened the Foundation aim into testable acceptance criteria"
# is the harness-wide premature-hand-off guard (spec § Interfaces). It is included
# in the AC-3 regex set per spec; aim-handoff.md is the sole fixture exempt from it
# (not this one).
  # NOTE: bare topic-nouns (rollout|migration path|backfill|workaround) were
  # REMOVED — they false-positived on legitimate deflections that NAME the
  # deferred topic (pass@5: an agent deflecting "we'll defer the migration
  # path" tripped the bare token though it stayed shallow). Replaced with
  # interrogative/verb-anchored forms so the backstop fires only when the
  # agent ASKS a design question, not when it names a topic it is deferring.
  # Layer-2 rubric remains the PRIMARY shallow check (ADR-0005).
