# /m-cross-provider-architect — Pattern A Composite Skill

Same skill-form Pattern A shape as `m-cross-provider-reviewer`, but pairs CC `architect` with Codex `codex-adversarial-reviewer`. The asymmetry is intentional: CC validates, Codex critiques — different roles within Pattern A.

## Inputs (JSON envelope as `args`)

```json
{
  "task": "<arch proposal, design spec, or tradeoff question>",
  "task_dir": "<optional: absolute path for artifact write>",
  "role": "architect",
  "timeout_seconds": 900
}
```

## Procedure

### 1. Probe Codex (same as m-cross-provider-reviewer)

```bash
codex --version >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "codex_healthy=1" || echo "codex_healthy=0"
```

### 2. Parallel dispatch (single assistant message, two Agent tool calls)

If `codex_healthy=1`, in ONE message issue BOTH:

- `Agent(subagent_type: "everything-claude-code:architect", description: "CC architect", prompt: <task envelope>, model: "sonnet")`  <!-- # EXTERNAL DEP — everything-claude-code (Epic B vendors this) -->
- `Agent(subagent_type: "m-workflow:codex-adversarial-reviewer", description: "Codex adversarial critique", prompt: <task envelope>)`

Wait for both to return before synthesizing.

If `codex_healthy=0`, call only `everything-claude-code:architect` (with `model: "sonnet"`) and proceed to synthesis with `fallback_reason: "codex unavailable"`.

The `model: "sonnet"` override on the CC architect dispatch supersedes the agent's `model: opus` frontmatter — m-* family routes architecture work through Sonnet, not Opus, by policy.

### 3. Synthesis

The two outputs are intentionally different in tone. Synthesis must:
- List the validated design (CC architect) up top
- Append adversarial findings (Codex) as "pressure-test results"
- Cross-reference: when an adversarial finding contradicts a validated decision, flag explicitly
- End with a unified verdict: approve | revise | block — choose the more conservative across both

### 4. Write artifacts (same shape as m-cross-provider-reviewer)

- `<task_dir>/raw_cc.md` — architect output
- `<task_dir>/raw_codex.jsonl` — adversarial reviewer output
- `<task_dir>/review.md` — synthesis
- `<task_dir>/result.json` — schema v1

### 5. Return synthesis to caller

Skill body's final assistant text: the synthesized review.md content.

## Failure semantics

Same as `m-cross-provider-reviewer` — Codex probe/dispatch fail = CC-only fallback; both fail = `status: failed`; framework error = propagate.

## Cost note

Pattern A — ~2× tokens. Reserved for highest-leverage gates: `/m-workflow:arch-review` and `/m-workflow:design-spec` (architect-review stage).

## Dependencies

- `everything-claude-code:architect` (ECC, EXTERNAL) — CC validation backend. Epic B vendors or makes optional.
- `m-workflow:codex-adversarial-reviewer` (plugin-local) — Codex adversarial-critique backend.
- CC-only fallback: if ECC absent, run available provider(s) only + emit synthesis with a `fallback_reason` note; if BOTH absent → no synthesis, surfaced as failure. (Loud-degraded metadata deferred to E14.)
